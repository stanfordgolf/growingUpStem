            <p>
                Growing Up STEM is a student-run organization at Los Alamitos High School that seeks to provide STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) opportunities for the young minds of Los Al and beyond. Through these activities, we hope to inspire and instill an appreciation for the sciences among our youth, and, as they grow, to provide outlets in which they can explore their STEM-based interests.
